# CENG114-Homeworks
AYBU CENG114 Homeworks for 2023 Spring Term

HW2, HW3 & 4, and HW5 were given to a team of two students.
I implemented these tasks with my classmate, Ömer Faruk Özüyağlı.

Also, please note that the mini project was supposed to be made by a group of at least 3 students. 
Therefore, I worked with Ömer Faruk Özüyağlı, Esat Çelebi, and Mehmet Ali Yılmaz for this project.
