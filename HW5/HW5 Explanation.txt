In this homework you will implement recursive N-Queen problem solver using recursion.
Watch the lecture video and you will see necessary explanations on N-Queen problem.
Use the given codes and only change the //student code part in the NPuzzleRecursiveSolver.java.
If you touch any other part or your code is not compiled then you will directly get zero from the homework.
Correctness (N-queen is placed and queen can attack any other queen), quality of the code, and execution time will be considered during the grading.
This is a 2-students group assignment (you can do it alone if you want).
Write the name, surname, and identity in the top of NPuzzleRecursiveSolver.java code.
You will only submit NPuzzleRecursiveSolver.java (one student in the group will submit it.)
